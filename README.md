==============

It's Sense.app, for Android.

Building
========

The app requires the [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) for lambda-support.

If you intend on creating release builds, you should install the Crashlytics IntelliJ plugin and log in so that your builds and their Proguard info is registered with the service.

All other app dependencies are satisifed through the gradle build system, and Android Studio.
