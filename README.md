It's Sense for Android.

Building
========

In order to build the app, you will need to have the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">JDK 8</a> installed due to the app using RetroLambda. All other dependencies should be resolved by Android Studio and the gradle build system. You should also install the Crashlytics IntelliJ plugin if you intend on creating release builds.
